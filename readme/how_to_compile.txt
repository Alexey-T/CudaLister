First, install FPC and Lazarus:

1. Download FpcUpDeluxe: https://github.com/newpascal/fpcupdeluxe/releases
On Windows, you must unlock .exe file in the Windows Explorer dialog.

1a. In FpcUpDeluxe, choose FPC last release, install it first.
1b. In FpcUpDeluxe, choose Lazarus (last release or Git 'main'), install it next.

2. Download GitHub repos:
https://github.com/bgrabitmap/bgrabitmap (install first)
https://github.com/Alexey-T/ATFlatControls
https://github.com/Alexey-T/EncConv
https://github.com/Alexey-T/ATSynEdit (install after ATFlatControls and EncConv)
https://github.com/Alexey-T/EControl (install after ATSynEdit)
https://github.com/Alexey-T/ATSynEdit_Ex (install after EControl)
https://github.com/Alexey-T/CudaLister (no package here, only project)

3. Install .lpk packages into Lazarus (find all .lpk files, open them in IDE, install from Packages dialog).
In the Lazarus component palette, you should see the "AT Controls" tab:
TATButton, TATButtonsToolbar, TATListbox, TATScroll, TATSynEdit, TATLabelLink, TATGauge

4. In Lazarus IDE, open "cudalister.lpi" project, compile it.
Better use this IDE dialog: "Run / Compile many modes..."
